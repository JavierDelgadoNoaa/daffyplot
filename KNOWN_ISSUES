- For the grid* plots, the vertical axis is kept uniform. However, the horizontal axis
  is not, and if not configured to plot flagged entries, this could result in the 
  horizontal axes ranges for each plot being different.
 -> Actually it may be best to make all figures' horizontal axis end at forecast_duration
    to make comparison easier
- When creating plots that show actual date in the horizontal axis, the value may come 
  out an hour off due to DST and the fact that we're using localtime().
- When doing grid* plots and using a non-square number of cycles, it will create a square
  number of plots. e.g. if doing 12 cycles, it will create 16 plots
